Output

/* THIS IS BECAUSE READING A CHARACTER FROM "in_stream" MOVES THE POSITION
OF THE STREAM RELATIVE TO THE FILE ALONG BY ONE CHARACTER, AND NUMBERS SUCH
AS 123 ARE REPRESENTED AS A SEQUENCE OF CHARACTERS '1', '2', '3'. WHEN
ATTEMPTING TO READ AN INTEGER, THE PROGRAM CONTINUES READING IN INDIVIDUAL
DIGITS UNTIL IT HITS A WHITE SPACE. */
